# MongoDBCRUDWebAPICore
Contains sample for CRUD operations on MongoDB data through ASP.NET Core Web API. You can test CRUD operations by using any API Testing application like Postman etc. Refer to Model class to get idea about data being saved in Mongo DB.
I have used MongoDB community edition.
As COVID is trending all over the world hence sample database is created on that theme, no other reasons whatsoever. :) 

# LiveCovidTrackerWebApp
Also contains ASP.NET MVC Core Web App project which tracks live COVID cases in India across all states. It uses a public API exposed through a source website. Source is mentioned on home page.
